# Image-Processing-Exploring-Sobel-and-Edge-Kernels-in-OpenCV


Finding Edges in an Image Using Kernels
This exercise is a basic image processing exercise that applies custom kernels (like Sobel) to detect edges in an image.

What it includes:
Converting an image to grayscale

Manually defining kernels

Using OpenCVâ€™s filter2D to apply the kernels

Displaying the result with Matplotlib

The goal is to get a hands-on understanding of how kernels work, without relying on prebuilt models or advanced libraries.

This notebook (including the code) was provided as part of a course exercise and used to practice and apply theoretical concepts in a practical way.
